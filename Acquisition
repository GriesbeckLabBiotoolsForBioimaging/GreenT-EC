# The file acquisition works controlling the imaging set-up previously described in Fabritius, A. et al. Imaging-Based Screening Platform Assists Protein Engineering. Cell Chem Biol 25, 1554-1561 (2018). It was adapted for acquiring images over time using only one channel for exciting the mNeonGreen based indicators. The output is a numpy file for each plate which is identified for further picking if necesary. Normally, two images were acquired before adding calcium and the 4 images were acquired.
